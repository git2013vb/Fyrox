# Fyroxed (standalone)

A standalone version of FyroxEd - native editor of Fyrox Game Engine. The standalone version allows you 
only to create and edit scenes, but **not run your game in the editor**. Please see [the book](https://fyrox-book.github.io/) to learn how to use the editor in different ways.
