- Improvements for serializer, now it allows you correctly recover from serialization errors.

## Migration guide

**WARNING:** This release **does not** provide legacy sound system conversion to new one, which means if 
any of your scene had any sound, they will be lost!

Now there is limited access to `fyrox_sound` entities, there is no way to create sound contexts, sounds, 
effects manually. You have to use respective scene nodes (`Sound`, `Listener`) and `Effect` from 
`fyrox::scene::sound` module (and children modules). 

### Nodes

Since `Node` enumeration was removed, there is a new way of managing nodes:

- `Node` now is just `Box<dyn NodeTrait>` wrapped in a new-type-struct.
- Pattern matching was replaced with `cast` and `cast_mut` methods.
- In addition to `cast/cast_mut` there are two more complex methods for polymorphism: `query_component_ref` and
`query_component_mut` which are able to extract references to internal parts of the nodes. This now has only one
usage - `Light` enumeration was removed and `PointLight`, `SpotLight`, `DirectionalLight` provides unified access
to `BaseLight` component via `query_component_ref/query_component_mut`. `query_component` could be a bit slower,
since it might involve additional branching while attempting to query component. 
- `Base` node was replaced with `Pivot` node (and respective `PivotBuilder`), it happend due to problems with 
`Deref<Target = Base>/DerefMut` implementation, if `Base` is implementing `NodeTrait` then it must implement `Deref`
but implementing `Deref` for `Base` causes infinite deref coercion loop.
- To be able to create custom scene nodes and having the ability to serialize/deserialize scene graph with such
nodes, `NodeConstructorContainer` was added. It contains a simple map `UUID -> NodeConstructor` which allows to
pick the right node constructor based on type uuid at deserialization stage.

#### Replacing `BaseBuilder` with `PivotBuilder`

It is very simply, just wrap `BaseBuilder` with a `PivotBuilder` and call `build` on `PivotBuilder` instance:

```rust
// Before
fn create_pivot_node(graph: &mut Graph) -> Handle<Node> {
    BaseBuilder::new().build(graph)    
}

// After
fn create_pivot_node(graph: &mut Graph) -> Handle<Node> {
    PivotBuilder::new(BaseBuilder::new()).build(graph)
}
```

#### Pattern matching replacement

Pattern matching was replaced with 4 new methods `cast/cast_mut/query_component_ref/query_component_mut`:

```rust
fn set_sprite_color(node: &mut Node, color: Color) {
    // Use `cast_mut` when you are sure about the real node type.
    if let Some(sprite) = node.cast_mut::<Sprite>() {
        sprite.set_color(color);
    }
}

fn set_light_color(node: &mut Node, color: Color) {
    // Use query_component_mut if you unsure what is the exact type of the node.
    // In this example the `node` could be either PointLight, SpotLight, DirectionalLight,
    // since they're all provide access to `BaseLight` via `query_component_x` the function
    // will work with any of those types.
    if let Some(base_light) = node.query_component_mut::<BaseLight>() {
        base_light.set_color(color);
    }
}
```

### Listener

Now there is no need to manually sync position and orientation of the sound listener, all you need to do
instead is to create `Listener` node and attach it to your primary camera (or other scene node). Keep
in mind that the engine supports only one listener, which means that only one listener can be active 
at a time. The engine will not stop you from having multiple listeners active, however only first (the 
order is undefined) will be used to output sound.

### Sound sources

There is no more 2D/3D separation between sounds, all sounds in 3D by default. Every sound source now is
a scene node and can be created like so:

```rust
let sound = SoundBuilder::new(
    BaseBuilder::new().with_local_transform(
        TransformBuilder::new()
            .with_local_position(position)
            .build(),
    ),
)
.with_buffer(buffer.into())
.with_status(Status::Playing)
.with_play_once(true)
.with_gain(gain)
.with_radius(radius)
.with_rolloff_factor(rolloff_factor)
.build(graph);
```

Its API mimics `fyrox_sound` API so there should be now troubles in migration.

### Effects

Effects got a thin wrapper around `fyrox_sound` to make them compatible with `Sound` scene nodes, a reverb
effect instance can be created like so:

```rust
let reverb = ReverbEffectBuilder::new(BaseEffectBuilder::new().with_gain(0.7))
    .with_wet(0.5)
    .with_dry(0.5)
    .with_decay_time(3.0)
    .build(&mut scene.graph.sound_context);
```

A sound source can be attached to an effect like so:

```rust
graph
    .sound_context
    .effect_mut(self.reverb)
    .inputs_mut()
    .push(EffectInput {
        sound,
        filter: None,
    });
```

### Filters

Effect input filters API remain unchanged.

### Engine initialization

`Engine::new` signature has changed to accept `EngineInitParams`, all previous argument were moved to the 
structure. However, there are some new engine initialization parameters, like `serialization_context` and
`resource_manager`. Previously `resource_manager` was created implicitly, currently it has to be created
outside and passed to `EngineInitParams`. This is because of new `SerializationContext` which contains
a set of constructors for various types that may be used in the engine and be added by external plugins.
Typical engine initialization could look something like this:

```rust
use fyrox::engine::{Engine, EngineInitParams};
use fyrox::window::WindowBuilder;
use fyrox::engine::resource_manager::ResourceManager;
use fyrox::event_loop::EventLoop;
use std::sync::Arc;
use fyrox::engine::SerializationContext;

fn init_engine() {
    let evt = EventLoop::new();
    let window_builder = WindowBuilder::new()
        .with_title("Test")
        .with_fullscreen(None);
    let serialization_context = Arc::new(SerializationContext::new());
    let mut engine = Engine::new(EngineInitParams {
        window_builder,
        resource_manager: ResourceManager::new(serialization_context.clone()),
        serialization_context,
        events_loop: &evt,
        vsync: false,
    })
    .unwrap();
}
```

## Serialization

Engine and ResourceManager both are non-serializable anymore. It changes approach of creating save files in games.
Previously you used something like this (following code snippets are modified versions of `save_load` example):

```rust
const SAVE_FILE: &str = "save.bin";

fn save(game: &mut Game) {
    let mut visitor = Visitor::new();

    game.engine.visit("Engine", visitor)?; // This no longer works
    game.game_scene.visit("GameScene", visitor)?;
    
    visitor.save_binary(Path::new(SAVE_FILE)).unwrap();
}

fn load(game: &mut Game) {
    if Path::new(SAVE_FILE).exists() {
        if let Some(game_scene) = game.game_scene.take() {
            game.engine.scenes.remove(game_scene.scene);
        }

        let mut visitor = block_on(Visitor::load_binary(SAVE_FILE)).unwrap();

        game.engine.visit("Engine", visitor)?; // This no longer works
        game.game_scene.visit("GameScene", visitor)?;
    }
}
```

However, on practice this approach could lead to some undesirable side effects. The main problem with the old 
approach is that when you serialize the engine, it serializes all scenes you have. This fact is more or less
ok if you have only one scene, but if you have two and more scenes (for example one for menu and one for 
game level) it writes/reads redundant data. The second problem is that you cannot load saved games asynchronously
using the old approach, because it takes mutable access of the engine and prevents you from off-threading work.

The new approach is much more flexible and do not have such issues, instead of saving the entire state of the
engine, you just save and load only what you actually need:

```rust
const SAVE_FILE: &str = "save.bin";

fn save(game: &mut Game) {
    if let Some(game_scene) = game.game_scene.as_mut() {
        let mut visitor = Visitor::new();

        // Serialize game scene first.
        game.engine.scenes[game_scene.scene]
            .save("Scene", &mut visitor)
            .unwrap();
        // Then serialize the game scene.
        game_scene.visit("GameScene", &mut visitor).unwrap();

        // And call save method to write everything to disk.
        visitor.save_binary(Path::new(SAVE_FILE)).unwrap();
    }
}

// Notice that load is now async.
async fn load(game: &mut Game) {
    // Try to load saved game.
    if Path::new(SAVE_FILE).exists() {
        // Remove current scene first.
        if let Some(game_scene) = game.game_scene.take() {
            game.engine.scenes.remove(game_scene.scene);
        }

        let mut visitor = Visitor::load_binary(SAVE_FILE).await.unwrap();

        let scene = SceneLoader::load("Scene", &mut visitor)
            .unwrap()
            .finish(game.engine.resource_manager.clone())
            .await;

        let mut game_scene = GameScene::default();
        game_scene.visit("GameScene", &mut visitor).unwrap();

        game_scene.scene = game.engine.scenes.add(scene);
        game.game_scene = Some(game_scene);
    }
}
```

As you can see in the new approach you save your scene and some level data, and on load - you load the scene, add
it to the engine as usual and load level's data. The new approach is a bit more verbose, but it is much more 
flexible.

## Breaking changes and migration guide

There are lots of breaking changes in this version, however all of them mostly related to the code and scenes made in
previous version _should_ still be loadable.

### Convert old scenes to new format

At first, install the rusty-editor from crates.io and run it:

```shell
cargo install rusty-editor
rusty-editor
```

And then just re-save your scenes one-by-one. After this all your scenes will be converted to the newest version.
Keep in mind that the editor from GitHub repo (0.25+) is not longer have backward compatibility/conversion code!

### 2D scenes

2D scene were completely removed and almost every 2D node were removed, there is only one "2D" node left - Rectangle.
2D now implemented in 3D scenes, you have to use orthographic camera for that. There is no migration guide for 2D scenes
because 2D had rudimentary support, and I highly doubt that there is any project that uses 2D of the engine.

## Resource management

Resource manager has changed its API and gained some useful features that should save you some time. 

`request_texture` now accepts only one argument - path to texture, second argument was used to pass 
`TextureImportOptions`. Import options now should be located in a separate options file. For example, you have a 
`foo.jpg` texture and you want to change its import options (compression, wrapping modes, mip maps, etc.). To do this
you should create `foo.jpg.options` file in the same directory near your file with following content (each field is
optional):

```text
(
    minification_filter: LinearMipMapLinear,
    magnification_filter: Linear,
    s_wrap_mode: Repeat,
    t_wrap_mode: Repeat,
    anisotropy: 16,
    compression: NoCompression,
)
```

The engine will read this file when you'll call `request_texture` and it will apply the options on the first load.
This file is not mandatory, you can always set global import defaults in resource manage by calling 
`set_texture_import_options`.

`request_model` have the same changes, there is only one argument and import options were moved to options file:

```text
(
    material_search_options: RecursiveUp
)
```

Again, all fields aren't mandatory and the entire file can be omitted, global import defaults can be set by calling
`set_model_import_options`.

### Physics

Old physics was replaced with new scene nodes: RigidBody, Collider, Joint. Old scenes will be automatically converted
on load, you should convert your scenes as soon as possible using the editor (open your scene and save it, that will
do the conversion).

Now there are two ways of adding a rigid body to a scene node:

- If you want your object to have a rigid body (for example a crate with box rigid body), your object must be 
**child** object of a rigid body. Graphically it can be represented like this:

```text
- Rigid Body
  - Crate3DModel
  - Cuboid Collider     
```

- If you want your object to have a rigid body that should move together with your object (to simulate hit boxes for 
example), then rigid body must be child object of your object. Additionally it should be marked as `Kinematic`, 
otherwise it will be affected by simulation (simply speaking it will fall on ground). Graphically it can be 
represented like this:

```text
- Limb
  - Rigid Body
     - Capsule Collider
```

#### Migration

This section will help you to migrate to new physics.

##### Rigid bodies

Rigid body and colliders now can be created like so:

```rust
use fyrox::{
    core::{algebra::Vector3, pool::Handle},
    scene::{
        base::BaseBuilder,
        collider::{ColliderBuilder, ColliderShape},
        node::Node,
        rigidbody::RigidBodyBuilder,
        transform::TransformBuilder,
        Scene,
    },
};

fn create_capsule_rigid_body(scene: &mut Scene) -> Handle<Node> {
    RigidBodyBuilder::new(
        BaseBuilder::new()
            .with_local_transform(
                // To position, rotate rigid body you should use engine's transform.
                TransformBuilder::new()
                    .with_local_position(Vector3::new(1.0, 2.0, 3.0))
                    .build(),
            )
            .with_children(&[
                // It is very important to add at least one child collider node, otherwise rigid
                // body will not do collision response.
                ColliderBuilder::new(
                    BaseBuilder::new().with_local_transform(
                        // Colliders can have relative position to their parent rigid bodies.
                        TransformBuilder::new()
                            .with_local_position(Vector3::new(0.0, 0.5, 0.0))
                            .build(),
                    ),
                )
                // Rest of properties can be set almost as before.
                .with_friction(0.2)
                .with_restitution(0.1)
                .with_shape(ColliderShape::capsule_y(0.5, 0.2))
                .build(&mut scene.graph),
            ]),
    )
    // Rest of properties can be set almost as before.
    .with_mass(2.0)
    .with_ang_damping(0.1)
    .with_lin_vel(Vector3::new(2.0, 1.0, 3.0))
    .with_ang_vel(Vector3::new(0.1, 0.1, 0.1))
    .build(&mut scene.graph)
}
```

##### Joints

Joints can be created in a similar way:

```rust
fn create_ball_joint(scene: &mut Scene) -> Handle<Node> {
    JointBuilder::new(BaseBuilder::new())
        .with_params(JointParams::BallJoint(BallJoint {
            local_anchor1: Vector3::new(1.0, 0.0, 0.0),
            local_anchor2: Vector3::new(-1.0, 0.0, 0.0),
            limits_local_axis1: Vector3::new(1.0, 0.0, 0.0),
            limits_local_axis2: Vector3::new(1.0, 0.0, 0.0),
            limits_enabled: true,
            limits_angle: 45.0,
        }))
        .with_body1(create_capsule_rigid_body(scene))
        .with_body2(create_capsule_rigid_body(scene))
        .build(&mut scene.graph)
}
```

##### Raycasting

Raycasting located in `scene.graph.physics`, there were almost no changes to it, except now it returns handles to
scene nodes instead of raw collider handles.

##### Contact info

Contact info can now be queried from the collider node itself, via `contacts()` method.

```rust
fn query_contacts(collider: Handle<Node>, graph: &Graph) -> impl Iterator<Item = ContactPair> {
    graph[collider].as_collider().contacts(&graph.physics)
}
```
