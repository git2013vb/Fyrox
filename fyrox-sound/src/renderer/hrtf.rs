//! Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) module. Provides all needed types and methods for HRTF rendering.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! HRTF stands for [Head-Related Transfer Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-related_transfer_function)
//! and can work only with spatial sounds. For each of such sound source after it was processed by HRTF you can
//! definitely tell from which locationsound came from. In other words HRTF improves perception of sound to
//! the level of real life.
//!
//! # HRIR Spheres
//!
//! This library uses Head-Related Impulse Response (HRIR) spheres to create HRTF spheres. HRTF sphere is a set of
//! points in 3D space which are connected into a mesh forming triangulated sphere. Each point contains spectrum
//! for left and right ears which will be used to modify samples from each spatial sound source to create binaural
//! sound. HRIR spheres can be found [here](https://github.com/mrDIMAS/hrir_sphere_builder/tree/master/hrtf_base/IRCAM)
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! To use HRTF you need to change default renderer to HRTF renderer like so:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use fyrox_sound::context::{self, SoundContext};
//! use fyrox_sound::renderer::hrtf::{HrtfRenderer};
//! use fyrox_sound::renderer::Renderer;
//! use std::path::Path;
//! use hrtf::HrirSphere;
//!
//! fn use_hrtf(context: &mut SoundContext) {
//!     // IRC_1002_C.bin is HRIR sphere in binary format, can be any valid HRIR sphere
//!     // from base mentioned above.
//!     let hrir_sphere = HrirSphere::from_file("examples/data/IRC_1002_C.bin", context::SAMPLE_RATE).unwrap();
//!
//!     context.state().set_renderer(Renderer::HrtfRenderer(HrtfRenderer::new(hrir_sphere)));
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! HRTF is `heavy`. Usually it 4-5 slower than default renderer, this is essential because HRTF requires some heavy
//! math (fast Fourier transform, convolution, etc.). On Ryzen 1700 it takes 400-450 Î¼s (0.4 - 0.45 ms) per source.
//! In most cases this is ok, engine works in separate thread and it has around 100 ms to prepare new portion of
//! samples for output device.
//!
//! # Known problems
//!
//! This renderer still suffers from small audible clicks in very fast moving sounds, clicks sounds more like
//! "buzzing" - it is due the fact that hrtf is different from frame to frame which gives "bumps" in amplitude
//! of signal because of phase shift each impulse response have. This can be fixed by short cross fade between
//! small amount of samples from previous frame with same amount of frames of current as proposed in
//! [here](http://csoundjournal.com/issue9/newHRTFOpcodes.html)
//!
//! Clicks can be reproduced by using clean sine wave of 440 Hz on some source moving around listener.
