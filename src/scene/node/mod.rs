/// Node is the basic building block for 3D scenes. It has multiple variants, but all of them share some
/// common functionality:
///
/// - Local and global [transform](super::transform::Transform)
/// - Info about connections with other nodes in scene
/// - Visibility state - local and global
/// - Name and tags
/// - Level of details
/// - Physics binding mode
///
/// The exact functionality depends on variant of the node, check the respective docs for a variant you
/// interested in.
///
/// # Hierarchy
///
/// Nodes can be connected with other nodes, so a child node will be moved/rotate/scaled together with parent
/// node. This has some analogy in real world - imagine a pen with a cap. The pen will be the parent node in
/// the hierarchy and the cap will be child node. When you moving the pen, the cap moves with it only if it
/// attached to the pen. The same principle works with scene nodes.
///
/// # Transform
///
/// The node has two kinds of transform - local and global. Local transform defines where the node is located
/// (translation) relative to origin, how much it is scaled (in percent) and rotated (around any arbitrary axis).
/// Global transform is almost the same, but it also includes the whole chain of transforms of parent nodes.
/// In the previous example with the pen, the cap has its own local transform which tells how much it should be
/// moved from origin to be exactly on top of the pen. But global transform of the cap includes transform of the
/// pen. So if you move the pen, the local transform of the cap will remain the same, but global transform will
/// include the transform of the pen.
///
/// # Name and tag
///
/// The node can have arbitrary name and tag. Both could be used to search the node in the graph. Unlike the name,
/// tag could be used to store some gameplay information about the node. For example you can place a [`Mesh`] node
/// that represents health pack model and it will have a name "HealthPack", in the tag you could put additional info
/// like "MediumPack", "SmallPack", etc. So 3D model will not have "garbage" in its name, it will be stored inside tag.
///
/// # Visibility
///
/// The now has two kinds of visibility - local and global. As with transform, everything here is pretty similar.
/// Local visibility defines if the node is visible as if it would be rendered alone, global visibility includes
/// the combined visibility of entire chain of parent nodes.
///
/// Please keep in mind that "visibility" here means some sort of a "switch" that tells the renderer whether to draw
/// the node or not. To fetch actual visibility of the node from a camera's perspective, use
/// [visibility cache](super::visibility::VisibilityCache) of the camera.
///
/// # Level of details
///
/// The node could control which children nodes should be drawn based on the distance to a camera, this is so called
/// level of detail functionality. There is a separate article about LODs, it can be found [here](super::base::LevelOfDetail).
