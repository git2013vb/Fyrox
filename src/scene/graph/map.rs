/// A `OriginalHandle -> CopyHandle` map. It is used to map handles to nodes after copying.
///
/// Scene nodes have lots of cross references, the simplest cross reference is a handle to parent node,
/// and a set of handles to children nodes. Skinned meshes also store handles to scenes nodes that
/// serve as bones. When you copy a node, you need handles of the copy to point to respective copies.
/// This map allows you to do this.
///
/// Mapping could fail if you do a partial copy of some hierarchy that does not have respective copies of
/// nodes that must be remapped. For example you can copy just a skinned mesh, but not its bones - in this
/// case mapping will fail, but you still can use old handles even it does not make any sense.
