/// Plugin is a convenient interface that allow you to extend engine's functionality.
///
/// # Engine vs Framework
///
/// There are two completely different approaches that could be used to use the engine: you either
/// use the engine in "true" engine mode, or use it in framework mode. The "true" engine mode fixes
/// high-level structure of your game and forces you to implement game logic inside plugins and
/// scripts. The framework mode provides low-level access to engine details and leaves implementation
/// details to you.
///
/// By default the engine, if used alone, **completely ignores** every plugin, it calls a few methods
/// ([`Plugin::on_register`], [`Plugin::on_standalone_init`]) and does not call any other methods.
/// The plugins are meant to be used only in "true" engine mode. If you're using the engine alone
/// (without the editor, executor, and required project structure), it means that you're using the
/// engine in **framework** mode and you're able to setup your project as you want.
///
/// The plugins managed either by `Executor` or the editor (`Fyroxed`). The first one is a small
/// framework that calls all methods of the plugin as it needs to be, `Executor` is used to build
/// final binary of your game. The editor is also able to use plugins, it manages them in special
/// way that guarantees some invariants.
///
/// # Interface details
///
/// There is one confusing part in the plugin interface: two methods that looks like they're doing
/// the same thing - [`Plugin::on_standalone_init`] and [`Plugin::on_enter_play_mode`]. However
/// there is one major difference in the two. The first method is called when the plugin is running
/// in a standalone mode (in game executor, which is final binary of your game). The second is used
/// in the editor and called when the editor enters "play mode".
///
/// The "play mode" is special and should be described a bit more. The editor is able to edit
/// scenes, there could be only one scene opened at a time. However your game could use multiple
/// scenes (for example one for game menu and one per game level). This fact leads to a problem:
/// how the game will know which scene is currently edited and requested for "play mode"?
/// [`Plugin::on_enter_play_mode`] solves the problem by providing you the handle to the active
/// scene, in this method you should force your game to use provided scene.
///
/// # Static vs dynamic plugins
///
/// Every plugin must be linked statically to ensure that everything is memory safe. There was some
/// long research about hot reloading and dynamic plugins (in DLLs) and it turned out that they're
/// not guaranteed to be memory safe because Rust does not have stable ABI. When a plugin compiled
/// into DLL, Rust compiler is free to reorder struct members in any way it needs to. It is not
/// guaranteed that two projects that uses the same library will have compatible ABI. This fact
/// indicates that you either have to use static linking of your plugins or provide C interface
/// to every part of the engine and "communicate" with plugin using C interface with C ABI (which
/// is standardized and guaranteed to be compatible). The main problem with C interface is
/// boilerplate code and the need to mark every structure "visible" through C interface with
/// `#[repr(C)]` attribute which is not always easy and even possible (because some structures could
/// be re-exported from dependencies). These are the main reasons why the engine uses static plugins.
